# Ajuste Final
"Ajuste Final" is a platformer game focused on narrative and puzzle solving with time limit. The game was developed using Unity Game Engine.

- Inside Unity, you can press Ctrl + O and open the scene "MenuScene.unity" under "AjusteFinal\Ajuste Final\Assets\Scenes" to start the game.

You can fully modify the project if you want, it would be great to see other people adding ideas to the game.
